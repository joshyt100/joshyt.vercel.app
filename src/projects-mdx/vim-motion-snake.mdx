  ## Overview  

  The **Vim Motion Snake Game** is a creative adaptation of the classic Snake game that replaces traditional controls with Vim-style motions (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`) for navigation. This game is perfect for Vim enthusiasts looking to sharpen their muscle memory while having fun!

  ## Key Features ‚ú®  

  - **Vim Motion Controls**: Navigate the snake using Vim's navigation keys:  
     - `h`: Move Left  
     - `j`: Move Down  
     - `k`: Move Up  
     - `l`: Move Right  
  - **Dynamic Gameplay**: The snake's speed increases as the score rises.  
  - **Interactive UI**: Displays the current score and a clean game-over screen with a replay option (`r`).  
  - **Smooth Grid Mechanics**: A responsive 400x400 grid ensures seamless gameplay.  
  - **Collision Detection**: Handles collisions with walls and the snake's own body.  

  ## Code Highlights üß©  

  ### 1. Motion Controls  

  The Vim-like navigation controls are bound using the `bind` method in Tkinter:  

  <CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`
    def bind_keys(self):
        self.master.bind("k", lambda event: self.change_direction("Up"))
        self.master.bind("j", lambda event: self.change_direction("Down"))
        self.master.bind("h", lambda event: self.change_direction("Left"))
        self.master.bind("l", lambda event: self.change_direction("Right"))
    `}
  />  

  ### 2. Drawing the Snake and Food  

  The snake and food are drawn dynamically on the canvas. The snake is a series of rectangles, and the food is represented as an oval:  

  <CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`
    def draw(self):
        self.canvas.delete("all")
        self.canvas.create_text(45, 10, text=f"Score: {self.score}", fill="white")

        for segment in self.snake:
            self.canvas.create_rectangle(
                segment[0], segment[1], segment[0] + 20, segment[1] + 20, fill="green"
            )

        self.canvas.create_oval(
            self.food[0], self.food[1], self.food[0] + 20, self.food[1] + 20, fill="red"
        )
    `}
  />
