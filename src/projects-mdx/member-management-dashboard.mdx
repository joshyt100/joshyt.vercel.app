  ## Overview

  The **Member Management Dashboard** is a full-stack application designed to streamline team and project management. It combines a **React frontend**, a **FastAPI backend**, and **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data storage and synchronization.

  ## Backend: Powered by FastAPI ‚öôÔ∏è

  The backend uses **FastAPI** to expose RESTful APIs that manage data efficiently. It integrates with **Firebase Firestore** for real-time updates.

  **Key Endpoints**:
  - `GET /members` ‚Üí Fetch all team members.
  - `POST /members` ‚Üí Add a new member.
  - `PUT /members/{id}` ‚Üí Update member details.
  - `DELETE /members/{id}` ‚Üí Delete a member by ID.

  Example for fetching members:

  <CodeBlock
    language="python"
    code={`
    @router.get("/members")
    def get_members():
        docs = db.collection("members").stream()
        return [doc.to_dict() | {"id": doc.id} for doc in docs]
    `}
  />

  ## Frontend: React & Responsive UI ‚ú®

  The frontend is built with **React** and styled using **Styled Components**. Key features include:
  - **Dynamic Modals**: Add and update members or projects seamlessly.
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Changes are reflected instantly across the app.
  - **Search and Filter**: Quickly search members or projects by name.

  Example of fetching and displaying members:

  <CodeBlock
    language="javascript"
    code={`
    const fetchMembers = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('/api/members');
      const data = await response.json();
      console.log(data);
    };

    fetchMembers();
    `}
  />

  ## Features
  - **Team Member Management**: Add, update, and delete team members.
  - **Project Management**: Associate members with projects dynamically.
  - **Real-Time Sync**: Changes instantly reflect in the UI with Firebase Firestore.
  - **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices.
