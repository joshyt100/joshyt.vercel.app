The **Multi-Threaded Purchase Order System** is a C++ application simulating inventory and order management for a wholesale tree company. It demonstrates the use of concurrent programming techniques to efficiently handle multiple producer threads and a single consumer thread.

### Key Components

1. **Inventory Management**
   - Reads the starting inventory from `inventory.old`.
   - Writes the updated inventory to `inventory.new`.

2. **Order Processing**
   - Producer threads read orders from files and place them into a bounded buffer.
   - The consumer thread processes these orders, updating the inventory or rejecting them if invalid.

3. **Bounded Buffer**
   - A circular buffer synchronizes the producers and the consumer efficiently.

4. **Transaction Log**
   - Outputs the results of order processing to a `log` file with formatted entries.

### Example Code: Producer and Consumer Threads

<CodeBlock
language="cpp"
    code={`
    void* producer(void* arg) {
    std::string filename = "orders" + std::to_string(*(int*)arg);
    std::ifstream orderFile(filename);

    Order order;
    while (orderFile >> order.customerId >> order.productId >> order.quantity) {
        boundedBuffer->insert(order);
    }

    // End-of-data signal
    Order endOrder;
    endOrder.isEndOfData = true;
    boundedBuffer->insert(endOrder);
}

void* consumer(void* arg) {
    while (true) {
        Order order = boundedBuffer->remove();
        if (order.isEndOfData) break;
        // Process order logic here
    }
}
    `}

/>

### Instructions to Run Locally

1. **Install a C++ Compiler**
   - Ensure `g++` is installed on your system. For Linux, you can install it with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install g++
     ```

2. **Compile the Program**
   - Use the following command to compile the code:
     ```bash
     g++ -std=c++11 -pthread proj05.cpp -o proj05
     ```

3. **Prepare Input Files**
   - Create an `inventory.old` file with the initial inventory.
   - Create `ordersN` files (`orders1`, `orders2`, etc.) with customer orders.

4. **Run the Program**
   - Execute the program with optional arguments for the number of producers (`-p`) and buffer size (`-b`):
     ```bash
     ./proj05 -p 3 -b 10
     ```
